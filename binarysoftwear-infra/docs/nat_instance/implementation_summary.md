# NAT Instance Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
- **Completion Date**: April 22, 2025
- **Project Goal**: Replace NAT Gateway with a more cost-effective NAT instance solution
- **Cost Savings**: Approximately $32.74/month ($392.88/year)

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Changes
The NAT Gateway in the BinarySoftwear infrastructure has been successfully replaced with an EC2-based NAT instance. This change maintains the same network functionality while significantly reducing costs.

### Components Deployed
1. **NAT Instance**
   - **Instance ID**: i-002b650d6b499fa5d
   - **Instance Type**: t3.small
   - **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2
   - **Public IP**: Elastic IP for stable addressing
   - **Placement**: First public subnet in the VPC

2. **Security Groups**
   - **Security Group ID**: sg-0ce5a1aa9b18119b1
   - **Inbound Rules**: HTTP(80) and HTTPS(443) from private subnets (10.0.3.0/24 and 10.0.4.0/24)
   - **Outbound Rules**: All traffic allowed

3. **Routing Configuration**
   - **Route Table ID**: rtb-0469f52b82adfec87
   - **Destination**: 0.0.0.0/0 (All traffic)
   - **Target**: NAT instance's network interface

4. **NAT Configuration**
   - IP forwarding enabled (`net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`)
   - iptables NAT rules for masquerading traffic from VPC CIDR
   - Configuration persists across reboots

## Implementation Process

### Steps Completed
1. Created a backup of existing NAT Gateway configuration
2. Developed NAT instance Terraform configuration
3. Applied Terraform changes to create NAT instance and security group
4. Associated Elastic IP with the NAT instance
5. Updated route table to direct traffic through the NAT instance
6. Verified connectivity from private instances
7. Confirmed proper NAT functionality

### Verification Tests
- Successful ping to 8.8.8.8 from private instances
- Confirmed external IP visibility via `curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com`
- Verified proper traffic flow through NAT instance

## Technical Details

### Terraform Resources
The following resources were created/modified:
- `aws_instance.nat_instance`: The EC2 NAT instance
- `aws_security_group.nat_instance_sg`: Security group for the NAT instance
- `aws_eip.nat_instance_eip`: Elastic IP for the NAT instance
- `aws_eip_association.nat_instance_eip_assoc`: Association of EIP to instance
- null_resource for route table updates

### Configuration Highlights
- Source/destination check disabled on the instance
- User data script configures IP forwarding and NAT rules
- Route table updates performed via AWS CLI to replace existing routes

## Future Considerations
1. **Monitoring**: Implement CloudWatch alarms for NAT instance health
2. **Redundancy**: Consider implementing redundant NAT instances for high availability
3. **Auto-recovery**: Add automated recovery mechanisms for instance failures
4. **Cost optimization**: Evaluate performance and right-size the instance if needed
